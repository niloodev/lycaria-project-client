## Proposal
Project developed by; Ezequiel Nilo (Programming), Axel Galz (Design), VamnKuma (Animation and Pixel ART) and Iz√°bi Ferros (Soundtrack).

Lycaria is a turn-based online game, it is divided in three parts; the client, server and the game. The project was developed with the intention of creating a simple and light form of entertainment for potential players, while developing a complex story behind it.

*The TCC (course conclusion project) was presented and delivered on 06/12/2021 as a project from Analysis and Systems Development technical course in ETEC Ant√¥nio de P√°dua Cardoso.*

* The application must have CRUD functionalities, to POST and GET from [Lycaria Server](https://github.com/niloodev/lycaria-project-server).
* Be capable of supply all design limitations from [Lycaria Game | Unity](https://github.com/niloodev/lycaria-project-server), and open it when the match starts - passing all the necessary info.
* Have Register, Login and necessary screens along with the Player Dashboard and Match Creation.

## Tools

This application uses the following open-source packages:

##### Core ones.
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) (Page to executable framework)
- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) (Web "framework")

##### Stylization.

- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Dynamic animation framework)

##### API requests and connection to server.
